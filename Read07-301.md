## Who is Roy Fielding? 

Adobe's leading scientist, Roy T. Fielding, is recognized for his innovative worldwide web, open source and software architecture work. It has written standards for HTTP/1.x and URI and has contributed to several other web technologies.

## Why don’t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?

Because they haven't been developed for such purpose. When Fielding and his colleagues began to develop the Web, it was a key priority to talk to every machine in the globe. However, most methods developed subsequently did not have these criteria to make computers speak to each other. You had just to speak with a limited number of machines.

## What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?

At the commencement of web addresses, the common HTTP abbreviation is the standard — or protocol — for documents transmission. Fielding was the main author of the still in use version.

## What does a GET do?

For requesting data from the given site, GET is utilized. And it is one of the most used techniques for HTTP.

## What does a POST do?

POST is a World Wide Web application technique offered by HTTP. In design, the POST request procedure requires that the data included in the query message be accepted by a web server and most likely to be saved. Used commonly when a file is loaded or when a finished online form is submitted.

## What does PUT do?

The HTTP PUT application method generates a new resource or replaces a target resource representation with the payload request.

## What does PATCH do?

Partial changes to a resource are used in the HTTP PATCH request technique. PATCH is slightly similar to the CRUD "update" notion (in general, HTTP is different than CRUD, and the two should not be confused). A PATCH request is taken as a set of guidelines for modifying a resource.
