Loops provide a fast and straightforward way to continually accomplish something. This JavaScript Guide section presents JavaScript's different iteration statements.

There are various types of loops, but they all basically accomplish the same thing: sometimes they repeat an activity. (Note that this value may be 0!)

The numerous loop mechanisms give distinct means of determining the beginning and end locations of the loop. There are several instances in which one sort of loop over the other is more easily served.

## The loop statements in JavaScript are as follows:

### 1. for statement:
A repeats for loop until a certain condition is wrong. The loop JavaScript is the same as the Java and C.

### 2. while statement:
A while statement performs its declarations as long as a certain condition is correct.

### and there is some statements loops provided in JavaScript such as: do...while statement, labeled statement, break statement and continue statement.

## Operators:

The following types of operators are included in JavaScript. This section provides information about operators and the precedence of operators.

### 1. assignment operator:

An assignment operator assigns a value to the left operand based on its right operand value. The basic assignment operator is identical (=). The value of your right operand is assigned to your left operand. In other words, x = y attributes y to x.

### 2. comparison operator:

A comparison operator compares its operands and returns a logical value depending on the real nature of the comparison. Numerical, string, logical or object values are available. Strings are compared with Unicode values on the basis of conventional lexicographic ordering. In most situations, JavaScript will attempt to convert these to a type suitable for comparison if the two operands are not of the same type. This usually leads to numerical comparisons of the operands. The only exceptions to the conversion type inside comparisons include the operators === and !== which make rigorous comparisons between equality and inequality. Before verifying equality, these operators do not try to transform operands to compatible types.

## Expressions:

An expression is a valid code unit that solves a value. There are two sorts of expressions: side effect(s) (for example those that assign value to a variable) and, in some sense, those that evaluate and therefore resolve a value. There are two different kinds of expressions. The expression a = 1 is a first type example. The = operator is used to assign the value 1 to the variable x. The expression itself is valued at 1.

Code 2 + 2 is the second type of phrase example. The + operator utilizes this equation to add two and two without allocating the result, four, to one variable.

### JavaScript has the following expression categories:
#### 1. Primary expressions
#### 2. Left-hand-side expressions
