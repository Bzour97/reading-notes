## JavaScript : 

Is a language for creating dynamic content updating, controlling multimedia, animating graphics, and much more. (Alright, not everything, but it's awesome what you can do with few JavaScript lines of code.)

## What does JavaScript perform on our web page?
We'll start looking at some code here and investigate what occurs when you execute some JavaScript on your website while doing so. Then let's sum it up for a little when you load a website in a browser what happens (first talked about in our How CSS works article). You run the code (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) inside a running environment when loading a web page into your browser (the browser tab). This is like a plant that uses raw materials (codes) and produces a product (the web page).

The Document Object Model API is very often used for the dynamical modification of HTML and CSS to a user interface (as mentioned above). Note that in the order it appears on the page, the code in your web documents is typically loaded and carried out. Errors may arise if JavaScript has been loaded and executed before HTML and CSS to be modified. Later in the essay, in the loading techniques part of the Script, you will learn about this.

## JavaScript data Types :
#### **Note : JavaScript variables can be : Numbers , Strings , Objects , Arrays , Functions**

### 1. JavaScript Variables :

JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values. For example :

*var x = 1*

*var z = x + y*

### 2. JavaScript Objects :

You have already learned that JavaScript variables are containers for data values. This code assigns a simple value (BMW) to a variable named person :

*var person = "Ahmad"*

Objects are variables too. But objects can contain many values. This code assigns many values (Ahmad, 172) to a variable named person:

*var person = {name:"Ahmad", tall:"172"}*

### 3. JavaScript Strings :

Strings store text. Strings are written inside quotes. You can use single or double quotes. For example :

*var color = "black"*

*var color = 'blue'*
