## What does .map() return?

The function map() produces a map object (an iterator) of results after each of the iterable components has received the assigned function (list, array, etc.).

## How can I accomplish this in React if I want to cycle through an array and show every value in JSX?

With curly brackets {} you may build up and integrate groupings of items in JSX. We use the map() function of JavaScript to cycle through the number array. For each element, we return a < li > item. Finally, we assign to listItems the resultant array of items. In the < ul > element we insert and show the whole array of listItems into the DOM.

## The Spread Operator

Spread Operator: is a new complement to the JavaScript ES6 set of operators. It takes an iterable (e.g. array) into different elements and is used to produce shallow copy of JS objects. The code is concisely and readability improved with this operator.

## Spread operator can do that:

* Copying an array

* Concatenating or combining arrays

* Using Math functions

* Using an array as arguments

### And more...

## Spread operator to combine two arrays, Example:

* const yourArray = [🙂,🤗,🤩]

* const myArray = [🤪,🐻,🎌]

* const ourArray = […myArray,…yourArray]

## Spread operator to add a new item to an array, Example:

const fewMoreFruit = [‘🍉’, ‘🍍’, …fewFruit]

const fewFruit = [‘🍏’,’🍊’,’🍌’]

## Spread operator to combine two objects into one, Example:

const objectOne = {hello: “🤪”}

const objectTwo = {world: “🐻”}

const objectThree = {…objectOne, …objectTwo, laugh: “😂”}

console.log(objectThree) // Object { hello: “🤪”, world: “🐻”, laugh: “😂” }
