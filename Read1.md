# Markdown ðŸ¥°

Is a web styling approach. The presentation of the text is controllable; the bold or italic style of words, the addition of pictures and the list creation are only a few of the things Markdown can perform. Markdown is usually a standard text with a few non-alphabetic characters, such as # or *.

## Most areas around GitHub can be used via markdown:

- Gists
- Comments on questions and requests for referrals
- .md or.markdown extension files

### But here we will talk in more detail about :

1. Headings :
To create the header, add one to six #characters before the header text. The number # is what determines the size of the address, since the more # the greater the size, but if it is more, the size will decrease.

2. Styling text :
You can indicate emphasis with bold, italic, or strikethrough text in comment fields and .md files. Where if you put the text between ** from right and left, the text will be Bold . But if you put the text between * from right and left, the text will be Italic.

3. Links
By wrapping link text in brackets you may create an inline link [], and then wrap the URL into brackets ( ). The + k keyboard instruction can also be used to build a link.  For example: This site for translate [Google Translate](https://translate.google.com/).
