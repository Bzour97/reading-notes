## What is functional programming?

Functional programming is a paradigm of programming that constructs programs by implementing and building functions.

## What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?

When the same parameters are given, the function returns always the same result. It does not depend on any change in condition or data during the execution of a program. It simply has to depend on the reasons it provides.

## What are the benefits of a pure function?

They’re easier to reason about, easier to debug, easier to test, easier to combine. And they’re easier to parallelize.

## What is immutability?

Immutability is important to improve the consistency and predictability of our functions. It remains unaltered or cannot be changed over time.

## What is Referential transparency?

Translation by reference, a concept often used for functional programming, indicates that you always obtain the same result with a function and an input value. This implies that the function does not utilize an external case.

## What is a module?

Is a functionality simple or complex, which can be reused throughout the whole node in a single or multiple JavaScript file.

## What does the word ‘require’ do?

Data for import.

## How do we bring another module into the file the we are working in?

We may accomplish this using the term requirements and the route of the module.

## What do we have to do to make a module available?

We may do this by using (module.exports = what we want). So we may export the data we want to disclose.
