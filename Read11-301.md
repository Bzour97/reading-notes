# Authentication

## What is OAuth ?

An open-standard permit protocol or framework specifies how unaffiliated servers and utilities can securely access your assets authorized without the original login credential being actually shared. This is characterized as safe, third-party, user-agent, delegated authorisation in authentication

## Give an example of what using OAuth would look like ?

The simplest OAuth example is if you log into a website and it provides one or more log-in chances for another website/service connection. Then click on a connected button on the other website and authenticate you on the other website and then use the authorization obtained from the second website to connect to the logs you initially made.

## How does OAuth work ? What are the steps that it takes to authenticate the user ?

Suppose a website or service was signed on by a user (OAuth only works using HTTPS). The user then begins a feature/transaction to visit another site or service that is not linked to them. The following (very simple) occurs:

1. The first website connects to the second website on behalf of the user, using OAuth, providing the user’s verified identity.

2. The second site generates a one-time token and a one-time secret unique to the transaction and parties involved.

3. The first site gives this token and secret to the initiating user’s client software.

4. The client’s software presents the request token and secret to their authorization provider (which may or may not be the second site).

5. If not already authenticated to the authorization provider, the client may be asked to authenticate. After authentication, the client is asked to approve the authorization transaction to the second website.

6. The user approves (or their software silently approves) a particular transaction type at the first website.

7. The user is given an approved access token (notice it’s no longer a request token).

8. The user gives the approved access token to the first website.

9. The first website gives the access token to the second website as proof of authentication on behalf of the user.

10. The second website lets the first website access their site on behalf of the user.

11. The user sees a successfully completed transaction occurring.

12. OAuth is not the first authentication/authorization system to work this way on behalf of the end-user. In fact, many authentication systems, notably Kerberos, work similarly. What is special about OAuth is its ability to work across the web and its wide adoption. It succeeded with adoption rates where previous attempts failed (for various reasons).

## What is OpenID ?

OpenID is a non-profit OpenID Foundation-promoted open standard and decentral authentication mechanism. It allows users to authenticate via cooperating sites (relying sites, or RPs) using an IDP, eliminates the need for webmakers to provide their own ad hoc login and allow users to log into multiple unrelated sites without having a separate ID or password. The IDP service allows users to access their own ad hoc login systems. Users create accounts by selecting an OpenID ID Provider, then use them to sign up for an OpenID authentication website. Many big companies either publish OpenIDs on their website or accept them.

# Authorization and Authentication flows

## What is the difference between authorization and authentication ?

Authentication is just the process of checking who a user is, whereas authorisation is the process of checking what the user accesses.

## What is Authorization Code Flow ?

Autorisation Code Flow is a procedure used to get an API request access token.

## What is Authorization Code Flow with Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE) ?

Code Authentication Flow for Native or Mobile Application Users with a Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE).

## What is Implicit Flow with Form Post ?

Implicit form post flow is a web-based sign-in procedure.

## What is Client Credentials Flow ?

The system authenticates and allows the app rather than a user with machine-to-machine (M2M) apps such as CLIs, daemons or services operating on your back end. Typical authentication systems such as username + password or social logins are meaningless for this circumstance. The client credentials flow is used by M2M apps instead.

## What is Device Authorization Flow ?

The gadget requests the user to go to a link on his computer or smartphone, and to permit the device, using input limited devices that connect with the Internet instead of authenticating the user directly. For devices that cannot enter text easily, this avoids a bad user experience. Device applications employ the device permission flow to achieve this (drafted in OAuth 2. 0). For mobile apps. For mobile.

## What is Resource Owner Password Flow ?

Although we don't advocate it, trustworthy apps can utilize the Resource Owner Password Flow which users generally use the interactive form to obtain credentials from users (username and password). The Password flow of resource owner should only be utilized if redirect-based flows cannot be used (such as Authorization Code Flow).
