## JavaScript

### JavaScript Instructions :

1. There are a number of statements in a script. Each declaration is like a stage in a recipe.

2. There are extremely accurate directions in the scripts. For example, before making a computation utilizing this variable, you may indicate that a value is to be recorded.

3. Variables are used to hold information parts utilized in the script temporarily.

4. Arrays are special sorts of variables which store several linked pieces of information.

5. JavaScript differentiates number (0-9), string (text) and Boolean values (true or false).

### Decisions and Loops :

1. You can combine more than one set of comparison operators with logical operators.

2. if: you can execute a piece of code other statements

3. Where a condition is true and where it is wrong, a condition other.

4. Switch statements allow you to compare a value with the potential results (and also provides a default option if none match).

5. Data types from one type to another may be forced.

## HTML

Like we mentioned in html, what is Markup represent, like hypertext?
The markings show the words and pictures of a web page to web browsers. An element is referred to as each unique code (Tags).

Two distinct element kinds (tags) are present:

1. Semantic element

Semantics means the right understanding of a word or phrase's meaning. Semantically, using a word is using a word in a manner correctly matched with the meaning of the term.

2. Structural element 

This element provides information about a document structure. This may also be linked to an appearance modification, but the essential is to offer information about the structure of a document in divisions, titles, sections, paragraphs or other features.

## CSS

The Cascading Style Sheets, often known as CSS, is a simple language developed to ease the web pages display process. CSS enables you to use web pages in styles. Most significantly, CSS can accomplish this regardless of which HTML each website consists.
CSS is easy to learn and understand, yet gives strong control over HTML page appearance.

### WHY CSS? 

1. CSS saves time: You can write CSS once and reuse the same sheet in multiple HTML pages.

2. Easy Maintainence: To make a global change simply change the style, and all elements in all the webpages will be updated automatically.

3. Search Engines: CSS is considered a clean coding technique, which means search engines won’t have to struggle to “read” its content.

4. Superior styles to HTML: CSS has a much wider array of attributes than HTML, so you can give a far better look to your HTML page in comparison to HTML attributes.

5. Offline Browsing: CSS can store web applications locally with the help of an offline cache. Using this we can view offline websites.
