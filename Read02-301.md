# React Lifecycle

What occurs first, based on the diagram, the "render" or the ‘componentDidMount’ ?

Render: is the only method in a class component required. This.props and this.state will be checked when called.

In the life cycle of Reaction, what is the first thing to happen?

## We have 3 stages The first invocation for each phase should be mounted, updated and removed:

* Mounting: constructor

* Updating: getDerivedStateFromProps

* Unmounting: componentWillUnmount

## Put in the order of the following things: Render, Constructor, componentDidMount, React Updates, componentWillUnmount

The constructor, renderer, componentDidMount, react updates, rendering and final componentWillUnmount is.

The componentDidMount() function allows us to run React code when the component is in the DOM (Document Object Model).

# React State Vs Props

## What kind of stuff can you slide through the props?

Reacting Proposals (or "properties") let us to transmit parent component values onto the child component. Values may be any form of data, from text to function, object, etc.

## What is the great difference between state and props?

The major distinction between advantages and state is that the state of the component itself is managed internally and whereas props are external and controlled through anything that constitutes the component.

## When will our application be rendered?

When their state or props are changed, reacting components are re-rendered automatically. The user interface (UI) components will be immediately restored from anywhere in the code by a simple status refresh. However, some instances may depend on some additional data for view() method.

## What instances are we able to save in state?

State is a normal JavaScript object used by React for information about the current status of a component. The component is managed (just like any variable declared in a function). The distinction is that when the "normal" variable is "disappearing," the status variables are maintained by React.
