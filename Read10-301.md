## What is a ‘call’ ?

At the fundamental level, the call stack is a structure that employs the concept Last In, First Out (LIFO) to store and manage function invocation momentarily (call).

## How many ‘calls’ can happen at once ?

At the time, just one call may occur.

## What does LIFO mean ?

The last function to be poured into the stack, the first to be pop out when the function returns, is when we say that the call stack operates according to the data structure concept of first out.

## Draw an example of a call stack and the functions that would need to be invoked to generate that call stack.

    function firstFunction(){
    console.log("Hello from firstFunction");
    }

    function secondFunction(){
    firstFunction();
    console.log("The end from secondFunction");
    }

    secondFunction();

## What causes a Stack Overflow ?

When a recursive function (a function that calls itself) is available without an exit point, a stack overflow occurs. The browser has the maximum call to stack that may be accommodated before a stack error occurs.

## What is a ‘refrence error’ ?

This is as easy as trying to use a variable you have this type of os error which is still not declared.

## What is a ‘syntax error’ ?

This occurs, I know, in the name of the errors, but it states, as if something cannot be scanned in terms of syntax, like if you attempt to use JSON.parse to scan an incorrect object.

## What is a ‘range error’ ?

Try to modify and supply an incorrect length of an object and this type of error will show up.

## What is a ‘tyep error’ ?

As the names suggest, this sort of error appears when you attempt to use or access types such as an undefined type of variable that access a property (number, string, etc.).

## What is a breakpoint ?

You may examine what happened before then while the line that you chose is running, then try to assess the following lines to see whether everything is produced.

## What does the word ‘debugger’ do in your code ?

In the line you wish to break, insert a debugger statement into your code.
