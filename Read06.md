You can design great-looking web pages with CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) but how does this operate beneath the hood? With a basic syntax example, this article describes what the CSS is and also includes essential terminology regarding language.

## For what use is CSS?
As noted before, CSS is a language to describe how users are presented with documents â€“ how they are designed, arranged, etc.

1. A document is generally a text file structured using a booking language - HTML is the primary bookmarking language, but other bookmarking languages, such SVG and XML, may also be found.
2. Submitting a document to a user involves turning it into a form that your audience can utilize. Browsers like Firefox, Chrome or Edge, such as computer screens, screens or printers, are designed to show documentation graphically.

## How To Add CSS ?

### There are three ways to Insert CSS :

1. External CSS :

You can modify the look of a whole website using an external style sheet by altering only one file! A reference to the external sheet style file within the < link > element, within the heading section must appear on each HTML page.

2. Internal CSS :

If a single HTML page has a distinct style, an internal style sheet may be utilized. Inside the < style > element in the head section the internal style is defined.

3. Inline CSS :

An inline style may be used to apply a unique style for a single element. To use inline styles, add the style attribute to the relevant element. The style attribute can contain any CSS property.

## Defining Colors in CSS :

1. RGB Color Values

Most of you have probably heard about CMYK values for print design. RGB, which stands for red, green, and blue is the color model that monitors use. Since in web design we're primarily concerned with what web pages look like on screens, RGB is the color model we use.

2. RGBA Color Values :

RGBA is all the rage. Seriously though, it's just like RGB, except with the addition of a fourth value: the alpha channel. The alpha value represents the level of transparency that the rgb color should have. It can be a value from 0 to 1 or a percentage from 0 to 100%. Note that you must specify RGBA instead of RGB.

3. HSL :

The HSL color model is one of the least used, but gaining traction because can be more intuitive to use when working with shades and color adjustments. HSL stands for: hue, saturation, and lightness
