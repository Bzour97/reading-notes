# Mongo and Mongoose

## Fill in the chart below with five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:

| SQL | No-SQL |
| ------------ | ------------- |
| Relational Databases | Distributed Database or Relational Non-Databases |
| Table based | Document based |
| Predefined schema | Dynamic schema |
| Vertically scalable | Horizontally scalable |

Not well suited to hierarchical storage suits hierarchical data storage better.

## What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database ?

For a sophisticated query-intensive environment the SQL databases are good.

## Give a real world example ?

### SQL database examples :

1. MySql

2. Postgres

3. Oracle

## What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database ?

* NoSQL : The database better matches the hierarchical data storage system as it follows JSON data-like key-value-pair storage method.

* NoSQL : For huge datasets, the database is highly favored.

## Give a real world example ?

### NoSQL database examples :

1. MongoDB

2. BigTable

3. Cassandra

## Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage ?

NoSQL database is more appropriate for hierarchical data storing.

## Which type of database is best for scalability ?

The benefits and limits of both SQL and NoSQL databases are their own; using their forces is the way forward. SQL databases are scalable vertically and NoSQL databases are scalable horizontally.

## What does SQL stand for ?

Stands for Structured Query Language.

## What is a relational database ?

A relational database is a kind of database that stores and gives access to linked data elements.

## What type of structure does a relational database work with ?

The relational model means that the logical data organization is distinct from the physical architecture of data tables, views and indices. This separation allows database administrators to adjust physical data storage without compromising logical access to data.

## What is a ‘schema’ ?

An abstract design is a schema of a database that describes your database storage. It defines both the data organization and the tables in a certain database. Developers are planning a schedule in advance so that they know which components are needed and how they link.

## What is a NoSQL database ?

Non-relation or distributed databases are usually referred to as NoSQL databases.

## How does it work ?

Designing a NoSQL scheme is a subject of some discussion as it has a dynamic scheme. Some claim that NoSQL's attraction is not to build a scheme, while others think that design is extremely essential since it doesn't give a solution for this sort of database.

## What is inside of a Mongo database ?

NoSQL DataBase.

## Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why ?

All records in MongoDB are kept as documents that have field collections with a dynamic diagram. Here, not the same number of fields are required for each collection, which makes them more versatile.

## What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database ?

The NoSQL databases have no Relational Databases dependability features.
