# Growth Mindset
### Simple Explanation :
* A mindset of growth thinks that patience and effort may develop one's core capabilities; intelligence and skill are just ideal beginning points. A passion of learning is a synonym for progress.

* in a fixed mindset and in contrast, intellect and talent are regarded as permanent features in a fixed way, which indicate that success comes exclusively from those innate abilities without further growth or effort.

The distinction between a stable and a growing mindset is illustrated by a simple illustration:

This notion reached me since I realized that I frequently get so far while trying things before I face a difficulty and quit. That's great and fantastic for climbing, judo or kite surfing (some of the many things I haven't mastered), but it's an issue when it comes to my profession.

I believe that it is my failure to utilize – and remain – a mentality of progress that stops me from smiling at home more often. Thus, I decided to write it in order to make myself known for moments of determination (and maybe in those moments you will identify yourself too) and share my work approaches.

If in such instances, when our brains return to a stuck state of thought, we can catch ourselves better, then we can go back to development and success.

### Perseverance, gumption traps, and maintaining a growth mindset :
1. Challenges: Here’s an example of when I wasn’t in the right mindset: learning Java.
2. Obstacles : My first impulse when I hit a roadblock is to immediately divert my attention to something else.
