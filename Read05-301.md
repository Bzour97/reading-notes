# React Docs - Thinking in React

## What is the single responsibility principle and how does it apply to components?

Use the same methods to decide if a new function or object should be created. One such method is the notion of single accountability, which ideally means just one component is to do. It should be broken down into smaller subcomponents if it finishes growing.

## What does it mean to build a ‘static’ version of your application?

You need to be able to trigger changes to your underlying data model in order to make your UI interactive. This is accomplished via React. In order to develop your app properly, you have to first consider the minimum amount of mutability your app needs. DRY is the key here: Do not repeat yourself. Do not repeat yourself. Figure the very minimum status of your application and calculate everything else on request. You can, for example, maintain an array of TODO items if you construct a TODO list; don't retain a separate count status variable. Instead, take the length of the TODO item array if you wish to show the TODO count.

## What are the three questions you can ask to determine if something is state?

* Can you compute it based on any other state or props in your component?
* Is it passed in from a parent via props?
* Does it remain unchanged over time?

How can you identify where state needs to live?

1. Identify all components that are based on the state.

2. Look for a common owner (a single component above all the components that need the state in the hierarchy).

3. The state should belong either to the common owner or a component further up in the hierarchy.

4. If you are unable to identify a component in the state, construct a new component to keep the state, then add it over the common owner component in a hierarchy.

# Higher-Order Functions

## What is a “higher-order function”?

higher-order function: At least one of the following is a function: Takes one or more functions, i.e. procedural parameters, and returns the resulting function.

## Explore the greaterThan function as defined in the reading. In your own words, what is line 2 of this function doing?

Another arrow function returning. m arrow m is more than n returned and the arrow function is there.

## Explain how either map or reduce operates, with regards to higher-order functions.

In this example the array is [1,2, 3, 4] and the function takes the starting point and each element from the array and combines it, then returns the array to a start to modify it. The reduction functure accepts 3 arguments, an array, a feature and a beginning point. That all implies that this reduction function accepts an array and a starting point and performs certain operations using the given function.
