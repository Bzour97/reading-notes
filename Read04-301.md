# React Docs - Forms:

## What is a ‘Controlled Component’?

With HTML, form components such as input, textarea and usually choose to retain and update their own status based on user input.

In React, mutable state is typically kept in the state property of components, and only updated with setState().

By making the react state the "one source of truth," we may integrate them together.

In addition, the react component which gives a formula governs the subsequent user input in that form.

## Should we wait to store the users responses from the form into state when they submit the form OR should we update the state with their responses as soon as they enter them? Why.

onChange = {this.handleChange} is the nuclear method for each typed string that will call the handelChange state and change the state by the SetState function

## How do we target what the user is entering if we have an event handler on an input field?

The value of the other UI components may now now be sent to, or reset from other events handlers.

# The Conditional (Ternary) Operator Explained:

## Why would we use a ternary operator?

1. What you really are testing is the condition. Your condition should produce in either a true or a false condition, or at least a boolean value.

2. Divides from our genuine value our conditional. Anything between the? and the: is done when the condition is true.

3. Colon, at last. If your condition is misleading, any code is run after the colon.

## Rewrite the following statement using a ternary statement:

      if(x===y){
     console.log(true);
      } else {
     console.log(false);
      }

### Solution

    x===y ? console.log(true) : console.log(false)
