# Introduction to React and Components

## What is a Component?

A Component is one of the core building blocks of React. In other words, we can say that every application you will develop in React will be made up of pieces called components. ... Components in React basically return a piece of JSX code that tells what should be rendered on the screen.

## Characteristics of Components

1. Reusability: Components are often intended to be reused in many contexts. Certain components might be tailored for a particular job, though.

2. Replaceable: Other comparable components can replace components easily.

3. Not specific context: Components are intended to work in many settings and environments.

4. Extensible: A component can be expanded to include new behavior by existing components.

5. Encapsulated: A component shows interfaces that let the caller utilize his or her functionality and does not show any internal processes or variables or status information.

6. Independent: Components should rely minimally on other components.

## The advantages of using component-based architecture

1. Ease of deployment: The ability to replace current versions without affect on other components or on the system as a whole is made easier with new compatible versions.

2. Reduced cost: The usage of components from other parties enables development and maintenance expenses to be distributed.

3. Ease of development: components implement renowned interfaces in order to provide defined functionality that enables development without affecting other elements of the system.

4. Reusable: the usage in many applications or systems of reusable components may be utilized to distribute cost for development and maintenance.

5. Modification of technical complexity: a component adjusts the complexity by using a container component and services.

6. Reliability: The overall reliability of the system is increased as the reliability of each component improves the overall reuse reliability.

7. System maintenance and evolution: easy implementation modification and update without impacting the rest of the system.

8. Independent: component connection independence and flexible. Independent component development simultaneous to each group. Software development productivity and future development of software.

## What are props short for?

is an unique React keyword that is proprietary and used for data transmission from one component to the next. In addition, props data is only read-only and should thus not be modified by child component data from the parent.

## How are props used in React?

1. Firstly, define an attribute and its value(data).
2. Then pass it to child component(s) by using Props.
3. Finally, render the Props Data.

## What is the flow of props?

A uni-directional flux passes the flux of the props. Moreover, the props data is read-only (one way from the parent to the kid), which implies that data from the parent should not be modified by the child.
