## HTML Images

### HTML Images Syntax
The HTML <img> tag is used to embed an image in a web page.

Images are not technically inserted into a web page; images are linked to web pages. The < img > tag creates a holding space for the referenced image.

The < img > tag is empty, it contains attributes only, and does not have a closing tag.

The < img > tag has two required attributes:

1. src - Specifies the path to the image
2. alt - Specifies an alternate text for the image

## HTML Video

The HTML < video > element is used to show a video on a web page.

### How it Works

The controls attribute adds video controls, like play, pause, and volume.

It is a good idea to always include width and height attributes. If height and width are not set, the page might flicker while the video loads.

The < source > element allows you to specify alternative video files which the browser may choose from. The browser will use the first recognized format.

The text between the < video > and < /video > tags will only be displayed in browsers that do not support the < video > element.

## HTML Audio

The HTML < audio > Element

### HTML Audio - How It Works

The controls attribute adds audio controls, like play, pause, and volume.

The < source > element allows you to specify alternative audio files which the browser may choose from. The browser will use the first recognized format.

The text between the < audio > and < /audio > tags will only be displayed in browsers that do not support the < audio > element.
