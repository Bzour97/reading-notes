### 1. HTML Unordered Lists

An unordered list is a collection of related items that have no special order or sequence. This list is created by using HTML < ul > tag. Each item in the list is marked with a bullet.

### 2. HTML Ordered Lists

If you are required to put your items in a numbered list instead of bulleted, then HTML ordered list will be used. This list is created by using < ol > tag. The numbering starts at one and is incremented by one for each successive ordered list element tagged with < li >.

### 3. HTML Definition Lists

HTML and XHTML supports a list style which is called definition lists where entries are listed like in a dictionary or encyclopedia. The definition list is the ideal way to present a glossary, list of terms, or other name/value list.

## CSS Box Model

In CSS, the term "box model" is used when talking about design and layout.

The CSS box model is essentially a box that wraps around every HTML element. It consists of: margins, borders, padding, and the actual content. The image below illustrates the box model:

JavaScript is a programming language that adds interactivity to your website. This happens in games, in the behavior of responses when buttons are pressed or with data entry on forms; with dynamic styling; with animation, etc. This article helps you get started with JavaScript and furthers your understanding of what is possible.

### Decisions and Loops (from switch statements)

All values evaluate to either truthy or falsy, there are three types of loop: for, while, and do … while. Each repeats a set of statements. And data types can be coerced from one type to another.

Definition and Usage :

+ The if/else statement is a part of JavaScript’s “Conditional” Statements, which are used to perform different actions based on different conditions.

+ In JavaScript we have the following conditional statements:

+ Use if to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specified condition is true
