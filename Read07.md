# Functions in JS

## Defining functions:

Function declarations: A function definition (also called a function declaration, or function statement) consists of the function keyword, followed by:

1. The name of the function.
2. A list of parameters to the function, enclosed in parentheses and separated by commas.
3. The JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in curly brackets, {...}.

### Function expressions:

While the above function statement is syntactically a statement, a function expression can also construct the functions. Such a feature may be nameless; it must not have a name.

### Calling functions:

It doesn't perform the definition of a function. Specifies what to do when the function is invoked by defining the function name. The function call actually performs the tasks requested using the arguments supplied.

## Control flow:

The flow of control is how the computer performs statements in a script. Code will run from the first line of the file to the last line if the computer goes over the (very common) structures, such as conditionals and loops, to modify the control flow.

Think of a script for user data validation from a web page form, for example. The script provides the data that has been validated, but the script encourages the user to fill in if he or she leaves a necessary field unfilled. To achieve this, the script utilizes a conditional structure or if, otherwise, it will run different code based on whether the form is complete.
